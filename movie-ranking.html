<h1>The best movies in my opinion</h1>
<h2>The top 3 movies of all time ranked in order of the best.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>1.Interstellar</h3>
<p>
    The most amazing sci-fi movie I've ever watched. This movie set my bar real high. It is going to be very difficult to prove me otherwise.
</p>
<h3>2.Shutter Island</h3>
<p>
    Film directed by the same director as Interstellar. Absolutely mind bending film. Really messes with your brain and leaves you wanting for more.
</p>
<h3>3.Inside out</h3>
<p>
    I know this one's surprising because it is a complete opposite genre of my first 2 picks. This is an animated movie that even adults are going to enjoy. Very feel good and heart warming. Guaranteed to leave you in tears
